# Spam/Phishing Classification

The project is aimed at solving a problem of classification of email data into the real ones and spam mails.
I have used data from kaggle.

In this project, I have tried to build a fairly accurate model on the basis of available data to classify text data and find out the spam mails from the pool of data available.
